# Text classification examples

## GLUE tasks

Based on the script [`run_glue.py`](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/blob/master/examples/text-classification/run_glue.py).

Fine-tuning the library models for sequence classification on the GLUE benchmark: [General Language Understanding
Evaluation](https://gluebenchmark.com/). This script can fine-tune any of the models on the [hub](https://huggingface.co/models)
and can also be used for your own data in a csv or a JSON file (the script might need some tweaks in that case, refer
to the comments inside for help).

GLUE is made up of a total of 9 different tasks. Here is how to run the script on one of them:

```bash
export TASK_NAME=mrpc

python run_glue.py \
  --model_name_or_path bert-base-cased \
  --task_name $TASK_NAME \
  --do_train \
  --do_eval \
  --max_seq_length 128 \
  --per_device_train_batch_size 32 \
  --learning_rate 2e-5 \
  --num_train_epochs 3 \
  --output_dir /tmp/$TASK_NAME/
```

where task name can be one of cola, sst2, mrpc, stsb, qqp, mnli, qnli, rte, wnli.

We get the following results on the dev set of the benchmark with the previous commands (with an exception for MRPC and
WNLI which are tiny and where we used 5 epochs isntead of 3). Trainings are seeded so you should obtain the same
results with PyTorch 1.6.0 (and close results with different versions), training times are given for information (a
single Titan RTX was used):

| Task  | Metric                       | Result      | Training time |
|-------|------------------------------|-------------|---------------|
| CoLA  | Matthew's corr               | 56.53       | 3:17          |
| SST-2 | Accuracy                     | 92.32       | 26:06         |
| MRPC  | F1/Accuracy                  | 88.85/84.07 | 2:21          |
| STS-B | Person/Spearman corr.        | 88.64/88.48 | 2:13          |
| QQP   | Accuracy/F1                  | 90.71/87.49 | 2:22:26       |
| MNLI  | Matched acc./Mismatched acc. | 83.91/84.10 | 2:35:23       |
| QNLI  | Accuracy                     | 90.66       | 40:57         |
| RTE   | Accuracy                     | 65.70       | 57            |
| WNLI  | Accuracy                     | 56.34       | 24            |

Some of these results are significantly different from the ones reported on the test set of GLUE benchmark on the
website. For QQP and WNLI, please refer to [FAQ #12](https://gluebenchmark.com/faq) on the website.

### Mixed precision training

If you have a GPU with mixed precision capabilities (architecture Pascal or more recent), you can use mixed precision
training with PyTorch 1.6.0 or latest, or by installing the [Apex](https://github.com/NVIDIA/apex) library for previous
versions. Just add the flag `--fp16` to your command launching one of the scripts mentioned above!

Using mixed precision training usually results in 2x-speedup for training with the same final results:

| Task  | Metric                       | Result      | Training time | Result (FP16) | Training time (FP16) |
|-------|------------------------------|-------------|---------------|---------------|----------------------|
| CoLA  | Matthew's corr               | 56.53       | 3:17          | 56.78         | 1:41                 |

| MRPC  | F1/Accuracy                  | 88.85/84.07 | 2:21          | 88.12/83.58   | 1:10                 |
| STS-B | Person/Spearman corr.        | 88.64/88.48 | 2:13          | 88.71/88.55   | 1:08                 |
| QQP   | Accuracy/F1                  | 90.71/87.49 | 2:22:26       | 90.67/87.43   | 1:11:54              |
| MNLI  | Matched acc./Mismatched acc. | 83.91/84.10 | 2:35:23       | 84.04/84.06   | 1:17:06              |
| QNLI  | Accuracy                     | 90.66       | 40:57         | 90.96         | 20:16                |

| WNLI  | Accuracy                     | 56.34       | 24            | 56.34         | 12                   |


## PyTorch version, no Trainer

Based on the script [`run_glue_no_trainer.py`](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/blob/master/examples/text-classification/run_glue_no_trainer.py).

Like `run_glue.py`, this script allows you to fine-tune any of the models on the [hub](https://huggingface.co/models) on a
text classification task, either a GLUE task or your own data in a csv or a JSON file. The main difference is that this
script exposes the bare training loop, to allow you to quickly experiment and add any customization you would like.

It offers less options than the script with `Trainer` (for instance you can easily change the options for the optimizer
or the dataloaders directly in the script) but still run in a distributed setup, on TPU and supports mixed precision by
the mean of the [ðŸ¤— `Accelerate`](https://github.com/huggingface/accelerate) library. You can use the script normally
after installing it:

```bash
pip install accelerate
```

then

```bash
export TASK_NAME=mrpc

python run_glue_no_trainer.py \
  --model_name_or_path bert-base-cased \
  --task_name $TASK_NAME \
  --max_length 128 \
  --per_device_train_batch_size 32 \
  --learning_rate 2e-5 \
  --num_train_epochs 3 \
  --output_dir /tmp/$TASK_NAME/
```

You can then use your usual launchers to run in it in a distributed environment, but the easiest way is to run

```bash
accelerate config
```

and reply to the questions asked. Then

```bash
accelerate test
```

that will check everything is ready for training. Finally, you can launch training with

```bash
export TASK_NAME=mrpc

accelerate launch run_glue_no_trainer.py \
  --model_name_or_path bert-base-cased \
  --task_name $TASK_NAME \
  --max_length 128 \
  --per_device_train_batch_size 32 \
  --learning_rate 2e-5 \
  --num_train_epochs 3 \
  --output_dir /tmp/$TASK_NAME/
```

This command is the same and will work for:

- a CPU-only setup
- a setup with one GPU
- a distributed training with several GPUs (single or multi node)
- a training on TPUs

Note that this library is in alpha release so your feedback is more than welcome if you encounter any problem using it.

Parameters:

            <https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/tree/master/examples>`__ for more details.
        do_eval (:obj:`bool`, `optional`):
            Whether to run evaluation on the validation set or not. Will be set to :obj:`True` if
            :obj:`evaluation_strategy` is different from :obj:`"no"`. This argument is not directly used by
            :class:`~transformers.Trainer`, it's intended to be used by your training/evaluation scripts instead. See
            the `example scripts <https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/tree/master/examples>`__ for more
            details.
        do_predict (:obj:`bool`, `optional`, defaults to :obj:`False`):
            Whether to run predictions on the test set or not. This argument is not directly used by

            details.
        evaluation_strategy (:obj:`str` or :class:`~transformers.trainer_utils.IntervalStrategy`, `optional`, defaults to :obj:`"no"`):
            The evaluation strategy to adopt during training. Possible values are:
                * :obj:`"no"`: No evaluation is done during training.
                * :obj:`"steps"`: Evaluation is done (and logged) every :obj:`eval_steps`.
                * :obj:`"epoch"`: Evaluation is done at the end of each epoch.
        prediction_loss_only (:obj:`bool`, `optional`, defaults to `False`):

                logging, evaluation, save will be conducted every ``gradient_accumulation_steps * xxx_step`` training
                examples.
        eval_accumulation_steps (:obj:`int`, `optional`):
            Number of predictions steps to accumulate the output tensors for, before moving the results to the CPU. If

            other choices will force the requested backend.
        fp16_full_eval (:obj:`bool`, `optional`, defaults to :obj:`False`):
            Whether to use full 16-bit precision evaluation instead of 32-bit. This will be faster and save memory but

        dataloader_num_workers (:obj:`int`, `optional`, defaults to 0):
            Number of subprocesses to use for data loading (PyTorch only). 0 means that the data will be loaded in the
            main process.
        past_index (:obj:`int`, `optional`, defaults to -1):
            Some models like :doc:`TransformerXL <../model_doc/transformerxl>` or :doc`XLNet <../model_doc/xlnet>` can
            make use of the past hidden states for their predictions. If this argument is set to a positive int, the
            ``Trainer`` will use the corresponding output (usually index 2) as the past state and feed it to the model

        remove_unused_columns (:obj:`bool`, `optional`, defaults to :obj:`True`):
            If using :obj:`datasets.Dataset` datasets, whether or not to automatically remove the columns unused by the
            model forward method.
            (Note that this behavior is not implemented for :class:`~transformers.TFTrainer` yet.)
        label_names (:obj:`List[str]`, `optional`):
            The list of keys in your dictionary of inputs that correspond to the labels.
            Will eventually default to :obj:`["labels"]` except if the model used is one of the
            :obj:`XxxForQuestionAnswering` in which case it will default to :obj:`["start_positions",
            "end_positions"]`.
        load_best_model_at_end (:obj:`bool`, `optional`, defaults to :obj:`False`):
            Whether or not to load the best model found during training at the end of training.
            .. note::

                the model will be saved after each evaluation.
        metric_for_best_model (:obj:`str`, `optional`):
            Use in conjunction with :obj:`load_best_model_at_end` to specify the metric to use to compare two different
            models. Must be the name of a metric returned by the evaluation with or without the prefix :obj:`"eval_"`.
            Will default to :obj:`"loss"` if unspecified and :obj:`load_best_model_at_end=True` (to use the evaluation
            loss).
            If you set this value, :obj:`greater_is_better` will default to :obj:`True`. Don't forget to set it to
            :obj:`False` if your metric is better when lower.
        greater_is_better (:obj:`bool`, `optional`):
            Use in conjunction with :obj:`load_best_model_at_end` and :obj:`metric_for_best_model` to specify if better
            models should have a greater metric or not. Will default to:
            - :obj:`True` if :obj:`metric_for_best_model` is set to a value that isn't :obj:`"loss"` or
              :obj:`"eval_loss"`.

        ignore_data_skip (:obj:`bool`, `optional`, defaults to :obj:`False`):
            When resuming training, whether or not to skip the epochs and batches to get the data loading at the same
            stage as in the previous training. If set to :obj:`True`, the training will begin faster (as that skipping
            step can take a long time) but will not yield the same results as the interrupted training would have.
        sharded_ddp (:obj:`bool`, :obj:`str` or list of :class:`~transformers.trainer_utils.ShardedDDPOption`, `optional`, defaults to :obj:`False`):
            Use Sharded DDP training from `FairScale <https://github.com/facebookresearch/fairscale>`__ (in distributed
            training only). This is an experimental feature.
            A list of options along the following:
            - :obj:`"simple"`: to use first instance of sharded DDP released by fairscale (:obj:`ShardedDDP`) similar
              to ZeRO-2.
            - :obj:`"zero_dp_2"`: to use the second instance of sharded DPP released by fairscale
              (:obj:`FullyShardedDDP`) in Zero-2 mode (with :obj:`reshard_after_forward=False`).
            - :obj:`"zero_dp_3"`: to use the second instance of sharded DPP released by fairscale
              (:obj:`FullyShardedDDP`) in Zero-3 mode (with :obj:`reshard_after_forward=True`).
            - :obj:`"offload"`: to add ZeRO-offload (only compatible with :obj:`"zero_dp_2"` and :obj:`"zero_dp_3"`).
            If a string is passed, it will be split on space. If a bool is passed, it will be converted to an empty
            list for :obj:`False` and :obj:`["simple"]` for :obj:`True`.
        deepspeed (:obj:`str` or :obj:`dict`, `optional`):
            Use `Deepspeed <https://github.com/microsoft/deepspeed>`__. This is an experimental feature and its API may
            evolve in the future. The value is either the location of DeepSpeed json config file (e.g.,
            ``ds_config.json``) or an already loaded json file as a :obj:`dict`"
        label_smoothing_factor (:obj:`float`, `optional`, defaults to 0.0):
            The label smoothing factor to use. Zero means no label smoothing, otherwise the underlying onehot-encoded
            labels are changed from 0s and 1s to :obj:`label_smoothing_factor/num_labels` and :obj:`1 -
            label_smoothing_factor + label_smoothing_factor/num_labels` respectively.
        adafactor (:obj:`bool`, `optional`, defaults to :obj:`False`):
            Whether or not to use the :class:`~transformers.Adafactor` optimizer instead of
            :class:`~transformers.AdamW`.
        group_by_length (:obj:`bool`, `optional`, defaults to :obj:`False`):
            Whether or not to group together samples of roughly the same length in the training dataset (to minimize
            padding applied and be more efficient). Only useful if applying dynamic padding.
        length_column_name (:obj:`str`, `optional`, defaults to :obj:`"length"`):
            Column name for precomputed lengths. If the column exists, grouping by length will use these values rather
            than computing them on train startup. Ignored unless :obj:`group_by_length` is :obj:`True` and the dataset
            is an instance of :obj:`Dataset`.
        report_to (:obj:`str` or :obj:`List[str]`, `optional`, defaults to :obj:`"all"`):
            The list of integrations to report the results and logs to. Supported platforms are :obj:`"azure_ml"`,
            :obj:`"comet_ml"`, :obj:`"mlflow"`, :obj:`"tensorboard"` and :obj:`"wandb"`. Use :obj:`"all"` to report to
            all integrations installed, :obj:`"none"` for no integrations.
        ddp_find_unused_parameters (:obj:`bool`, `optional`):
            When using distributed training, the value of the flag :obj:`find_unused_parameters` passed to
            :obj:`DistributedDataParallel`. Will default to :obj:`False` if gradient checkpointing is used, :obj:`True`
            otherwise.
        dataloader_pin_memory (:obj:`bool`, `optional`, defaults to :obj:`True`):
            Whether you want to pin memory in data loaders or not. Will default to :obj:`True`.
        skip_memory_metrics (:obj:`bool`, `optional`, defaults to :obj:`False`):
            Whether to skip adding of memory profiler reports to metrics. Defaults to :obj:`False`.
        push_to_hub (:obj:`bool`, `optional`, defaults to :obj:`False`):
            Whether or not to upload the trained model to the hub after training. This argument is not directly used by
            :class:`~transformers.Trainer`, it's intended to be used by your training/evaluation scripts instead. See
            the `example scripts <https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/tree/master/examples>`__ for more
            details.
